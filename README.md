## VS Code

### by Mary Githuthi


**Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor that runs on your desktop. It is the most popular choice for students and professional developers alike because it is highly customizable.

### Why Students Should Use It
- **Multi-platform:** It works perfectly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Extension Marketplace:** You can add support for Python, Java, C++, and even tools for AI like GitHub Copilot.
- **Built-in Terminal:** You can run your `git` commands directly inside the editor.
- **Integrated Debugging:** It helps you find and fix errors in your code quickly.

### How to Get Started
1. Download it for free from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the **Extensions** view (Ctrl+Shift+X) to install language support.
3. Use the `code .` command in your terminal to open projects instantly.

## Notion
Jackton Mboya

Notion is the ultimate "all-in-one" workspace that replaces a dozen other apps. For students, it acts as a digital brain—a single place where you can capture notes, manage complex projects, and organize your entire academic life. Unlike traditional word processors, Notion uses a unique "block" system, allowing you to drag and drop everything from text and images to databases and synced calendars.

Why Students Should Use It
Centralized Organization: Keep your class notes, assignment trackers, and personal journals in one searchable location.

Powerful Databases: Create custom tables to track your GPA, internship applications, or reading lists with automated reminders.

Collaboration: Work in real-time with teammates on group projects, leaving comments and tagging members directly on the page.

Free Pro Features: Students with a valid school email address can upgrade to the Personal Pro Plan for free, allowing for unlimited file uploads and version history.

How to Get Started
Sign up at notion.so using your student email to unlock the free education upgrade.

Start with a Template: Browse the "Student" category in the template gallery to find pre-made layouts for class notes and weekly agendas.

Master the Slash Command: Type / anywhere on a page to instantly add checkboxes, headers, or math equations.

## Canva
#### Prepared and notarized by Eshton
**Canva** are official repositories maintained by Canva (the graphic design company) for developers, including SDKs, API integrations, and open-source tools. It does not mean the Canva design application itself is open-source.
### Key Features for Students
* **Canva Developers & SDKs:** Canva provides resources for developers to build apps that run inside the Canva editor. This includes the Apps SDK, which allows developers to create custom UI elements, use APIs for interacting with designs, and build tools using JavaScript.
* **Connect APIs:** These tools allow third-party developers to programmatically access and embed Canva capabilities, such as creating designs or accessing user content from outside the Canva platform.
* **Open-Source Contributions:** Canva contributes to the developer community by open-sourcing specific tools they use, such as customisations for data streaming (e.g., amazon-kinesis-streams-for-fluent-bit).
### Examples
1. Canva-apps-sdk-starter-kit
2. Shows how to use the notification API to display messages in the Canva editor.
#### What it is not
- It is not a repository where you can download the source code for the main Canva design tool.
   - It is separate from Konva.js, which is a different, unrelated HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework.
> It is not the "Canvas LMS" (Learning Management System) often found on GitHub.
